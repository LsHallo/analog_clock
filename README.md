# Analog Clock in HTML/JS
This is a simple clock in html that utilizes a svg image for the numbers and a few lines of css and javascript to generate the rest.

It shows 4 written options for the time and only one is correct and corresponds to the time that is visible on the analog clock.
This is an ideal way to learn the clock in the browser.
